Discover Mapinou, a free mobile game where you have fun while helping science, crazy right?
Download the game on your phone and travel the trails of France to help Lapinou finding his friend.
Beware though! Predators roam the paths as well, and they won't hesitate to attack you if you get lost.

Mapinou is developped by the LostInZoom ERC team, directed by Guillaume Touya. It is a "serious" mobile game
as it uses the videogame format to gather data in order to better understand how we interact with online maps.
The collected data are anonymous.
